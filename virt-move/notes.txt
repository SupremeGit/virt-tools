Some simple but handy tools to find/fix KVM vm definiton files with missing images:

virt-check.sh

	# Script to quickly work out which vm definitions have missing images.
	# Can spit out a list of:
	#   - vm xml definition files (for either good or bad vms)
	#   - path to disk image file (either missing or found)
	#
	#Usage exanples:
	#
	#find bad vms:
	# ./virt-check.sh --check_vms --bad
	#/etc/libvirt/qemu/z_6Tb-ipa-rl2-01-sv-ipa.el6.xml
	#/etc/libvirt/qemu/z_6Tb-ipa-rl2-01-ws-ipa.el6.xml
	#
	#find the images in those vms that are missing:
	#./virt-check.sh --check_images --bad
	#/mnt/6Tb/Shared-6tb/data/kvm/vm/ranlads2/ipa/rhel-guest-image-6.7-20160301.1.x86_64-ipa.qcow2
	#/mnt/6Tb/Shared-6tb/data/kvm/vm/ranlads2/ipa/rhel6.7-ws-ipa.qcow2
	#

virt-move.pl

	#Update paths in VM xml configs,
	#Could currently be replaced with a single line perl regex, but may add more features later.
	#
	#Usage:
	#cat /etc/libvirt/qemu/vm.xml | virt-move.pl "/oldpath/" "/newpath/" > vm_fixed.xml

virt-fix-hack.sh 

	# Nasty hack to use virt-move.pl to carefully fix my dodgy vm files with images that I've moved to new locations
	#
	#"virt-fix-hack.sh [ --move ]
	#  --move    creates ${OLD_DIR} and moves old xml files there.
	# 
	# Uses virt-check.pl to examine vm xml files in current directory.
	# And uses virt-move.pl to fix vms which reference disk images that I've moved to new locations.
	# Fixed xml files will be created in ${FIXED_DIR}.
